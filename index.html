  <h1>Privacy Policy for [Your Extension Name]</h1>
  
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Company/Name] (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information

    you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect personal information from users of this Extension. The Extension operates locally 
    on your device to [briefly explain what your extension does]. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use or share any personal data. 
    Any temporary data processed by the Extension is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted 
    to our servers or any third party.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

    This Extension may interact with third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for

    of any third-party sites or services you visit.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect any data used by the Extension, but since data processing 
    is local to your device, security also depends on your device’s safeguards. 
    We recommend keeping your software and operating system up to date.

  <h1>Privacy Policy for Print My Recipe</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Print My Recipe (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, 
    and safeguards the information we may receive or process while providing our Chrome extension 
    (“the Extension”). By installing or using the Extension, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Print My Recipe does not collect or store personally identifiable information. The Extension 
    operates entirely on your local browser session to detect and format recipe-related content. 
    We do not transmit any user data to remote servers or third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect personal data, there is no usage or sharing of such information. Any 
    content processed by the Extension (like recipe text) stays within your browser and is never 
    stored on or sent to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Print My Recipe does not use cookies or tracking mechanisms. However, the sites you visit while 
    using the Extension may implement their own cookies or other tracking technologies. We are not 
    responsible for the privacy practices of external websites.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    This Extension does not integrate with or rely on any external service that collects or processes 
    user data. Any interaction with third-party websites or services is governed by the respective 
    privacy policies of those third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because the Extension does not collect or store personal information, we do not maintain any 
    databases or cloud storage containing user data. Nevertheless, we encourage users to keep their 
    browsers and operating systems updated to mitigate general security risks.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Print My Recipe is not designed for or directed toward children. We do not knowingly collect 
    personal information from individuals under the age of 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, 
    legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.
  </p>
